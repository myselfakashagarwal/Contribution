# Contribution

Intro
The main file in this repo that's useful to you is contribute.sh ........... This is a shell script aka mogicccccc 😂 This shell script will take some inputs like commit message, year, data to enter as contribution, and file for make contributions in. With the power of these inputs this shell script will provide extreme consistency 😂☕️ aka fake commits.

<br>

<h1>How to use </h1>
Download the contribute.sh file
<br>
Put contribute.sh file in your repo in which you wanna make fake commits in (Make sure that repo is useless)
<br>
Run the script using command:         bash contribute.sh 
<br>
Provide year make example ~ 2023
<br>
Provide a dummy file (That file must be in the current repo)
<br>
Provide message example ~ damm (Message must not contain spaces for reliability just type simple word)
<br>
Provide data aka contribution example ~ ☕️
<br>
press enter 
<br>
After the commits gets compleated push the commmits
<br>

<h1>Alert</h1>
In terms of wrong commits delete that repo 😂
<br>
To terminate script in between press ^c

#Best of luck 💀
