# Contribution

Intro
The main file in this repo that's useful to you is contribute.sh ........... This is a shell script aka mogicccccc 😂 This shell script will take some inputs like commit message, year, data to enter as contribution, and file for make contributions in. With the power of these inputs this shell script will provide extreme consistency 😂☕️ aka fake commits.

How to use 
Download the contribute.sh file
Put contribute.sh file in your repo in which you wanna make fake commits in (Make sure that repo is useless)
Run the script using command:         bash contribute.sh 
Provide year make example ~ 2023
Provide a dummy file (That file must be in the current repo)
Provide message example ~ "WE ARE A PART OF MATRIX"
Provide data aka contribution example ~ ☕️
press enter 
After the commits gets compleated push the commmits

Alert
In terms of wrong commits delete that repo 😂
To terminate script in between press ^c

Best of luck 💀
